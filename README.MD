##### Intro
This is a password strength meter gamification called Password Pet. It is designed to help and educate end users on passwords.

* Final_Boss Page
    * on click - Test your password pet in the wild - this will check the password up against an online password bank, testing the password in brute force attack. using the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) Passwords API.

* Safe/Pwned Page

        - this page shows a hacker w/sound and an alert message of you've been pawned.

##### How it works
* Start:
    * The game randomly picks an egg, and watch it grow into a mature strong dragon for better protection of your password.
    * The better the password the better the dragon! - use the guidance to help you achieve ultimate strength and Level up on your dragon.
    * You must remember your password - keep it easy to remember for the last check!
    * Life span - the higher the level the longer the life span of your dragon! - if life goes out you will need to feed your dragon with a new password - to stay strong and secure.

##### Hidden gems
* Ultimate power is achieved through extra password measures you take
    * 32 characters long - will grant you extra magic powers (need to add!)
